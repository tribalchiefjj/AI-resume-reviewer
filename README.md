# AI-Powered Resume Reviewer

first of all , While there are undoubtedly many tools and applications out there with similar functionalities, what sets this project apart is the personal approach Iâ€™ve taken to develop it from scratch. Building this tool has been a great way to learn, experiment, and integrate various advanced technologies. There's no better way to understand and showcase the capabilities of tools, models, and frameworks than by building something myself. This hands-on experience not only allows me to understand the details of each technology but also helps me demonstrate how I can solve real-world problems efficiently.


### Standout Functionalities:
- **User Role Selection**
- **Resume Parsing**
- **Job Fit Analysis**
- **Grammar Check**
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**

- ### Core Problem-Solving:
- **Job Fit Matching**: The app leverages keyword matching, semantic understanding (via NLP), and summarization to provide a match score, giving an immediate assessment of how well a resume fits the job description.
- **NLP & Summarization**: The app uses NLP techniques, including spaCy for text processing and Hugging Face transformers for summarizing job descriptions.

### Technical Depth:
- **Resume Parsing**: Using regex and text processing to extract specific sections of the resume, handling different file formats (txt, pdf, docx).
- **Job Description Summarization**: Uses advanced transformer models to summarize job descriptions, highlighting key job requirements.
- **Keyword Matching Algorithm**: Efficiently compares the content of resumes to job descriptions using simple but effective keyword matching techniques.
